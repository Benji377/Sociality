# Sociality
Sociality is a simple assistant like Google assistant, but written in Python and developed by a single junior programmer. You can find all his main functions in the Help.txt file or on my official Website. Feedback is always accepted. If you know ways to improve it or want a feature added, don't hesitate to contact me.
