# Sociality
There are actually 3 versions of the project Sociality right now. The first version can't be downloaded anymore because it was only a beta. The second version can be downloaded on Mediafire, you will find the link below. As my skills in programming grow, more and more versions will be released. The third version is already a work in progress and may be released in a month or two. When it will be released, it will replace the second version. The download link below will then redirect you to the third version. If you want more information about the assistant, just visit my blog, whose link you can also find below. On my blog there will also be the possibility to download other versions and write comments.
If you encounter any error or want to make a suggestion, just create an Issues or Pull request and I will take care of it.
