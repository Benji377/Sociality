Log, log:  Opens the Log.txt file or creates one. Everytime you search something with the assistant you will find it there. 
If you delete it, the assistant will automatically create a new one next time you search something. 
I'm still working on a solution to disable it. But for now it is perfect for taking notes.
The assistant can also do some simple math operations: x + x;  x - x;  x / x;  x * x

In the future I plan to make the Assistant faster, add other Aps and websites and add some voice commands to it. 
There will also be bug fixes if someone finds any. The update for the app will be next month, if everything goes well.

I just wanted to thank you all for the big support!.
